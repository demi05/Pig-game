# Pig-game
A two person game to test my JavaScript Skills.

This game was made majorly with JavaScript. It is from the Complete Javascrpit course, 2024 by Jonas Schmeddtman. The game is made such that if the score of any player is greater than or equal to 30, the player wins

I learnt to manipulate the DOM, work with classes to change styles such as active classes and other styles like color.
It was a great way to learn how to work with the DOM!
